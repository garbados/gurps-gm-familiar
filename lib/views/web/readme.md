# Familiar: Web Interface

The web interface to Familiar provides a visual interface to the following actions:

* design characters, save them to load later, and use them as templates.
* design settings, locations, and campaigns by treating them as wikis.
* use saved resources like locations and characters to automatically calculate modifiers for skill checks and other dice rolls.

As of this writing, the web interface is being used to understand and develop an optimal interface to the Familiar library itself, so feel free to let development get messy. This is a learning project.

To build the website, use `npm run build`. Then, `serve build`.

		"name": "360° Vision",
		"cost": 25,
		"physical": true,
		"exotic": true,
		"description": "You have a 360° field of vision. You have no penalty to defend against attacks from the sides or rear. You can attack foes to your sides or rear without making a Wild Swing, but you are at -2 to hit due to the clumsy angle of attack (note that some Karate techniques do not suffer this penalty). Finally, you are at +5 to detect Shadowing attempts, and are never surprised by a danger that comes from behind, unless it also is concealed from sight. Extra eyes are merely a special effect of this trait – you can have any number of eyes, but the point cost remains the same.",
		"limitations": {
			"Easy to Hit": {
				"modifier": -0.2,
				"description": "Your eyes are on stalks, unusually large, or otherwise more vulnerable to attack. Others can target your eyes from within their arc of vision at only -6 to hit."

		"description": "You have an excellent sense of direction. This ability comes in two levels:\n\n Absolute Direction: You always know which way is north, and you can always retrace a path you have followed within the past month, no matter how faint or confusing. This ability does not work in environments such as interstellar space or the limbo of the astral plane, but it does work underground, underwater, and on other planets. This gives +3 to Body Sense and Navigation (Air, Land, or Sea). (Note: The navigational sense that guides migratory creatures to their destination is too crude to qualify; treat it as a 0-point feature.) 5 points.",
		"limitations": {
			"Requires Signal": {
				"modifier": -0.2,
				"description": "You rely on signals from a navigational satellite network (like Earth’s GPS) or similar system. Your ability does not function in the absence of such a system, and it can be jammed."
			}

		"enhancements": {
			"3D Spatial Sense": {
				"cost": 5,
				"description": "Like Absolute Direction, but works in three dimensions. This ability is useful in deep space – although it does not help you if you travel across dimensions. You get the skill bonuses given for Absolute Direction, plus +1 to Piloting and +2 to Aerobatics, Free Fall, and Navigation (Hyperspace or Space)."

		"name": "Absolute Timing",
		"cost": 2,
		"mental": true,
		"description": "You always know what time it is, with a precision equal to the best personal timepieces widely available in your culture (but never better than a few seconds). You can measure elapsed time with equal accuracy. Neither changes of time zone nor sleep interferes with this ability, and you can wake up at a pre- determined time if you choose. Being knocked unconscious, hypnotized, etc. may prevent this advantage from working, and time travel will confuse you until you find out what the “new” time is.",
		"enhancements": {
			"Chronolocation": {
				"cost": 3,
				"description": "Like Absolute Timing, but time travel does not interfere – you always know what time it is in an absolute sense. Note that things like Daylight Savings Time and calendar reform can still confuse you! When you travel in time, the GM may tell you, “You have gone back exactly 92,876.3 days,” and let you – or your character – deal with questions like, “What about leap year?”"

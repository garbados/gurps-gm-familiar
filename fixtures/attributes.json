		"name": "strength",
		"description": "Strength measures physical power and bulk. It is crucial if you are a warrior in a primitive world, as high ST lets you dish out and absorb more damage in hand-to-hand combat. Any adventurer will find ST useful for lifting and throwing things, moving quickly with a load, etc. ST directly determines Basic Lift (p. 15), basic damage (p. 15), and Hit Points (p. 16), and affects your character’s Build (p. 18). Lifting capacity is proportional to the square of ST. Compared to the average human adult (ST 10 – 10x10 = 100), ST 14 is about twice as strong (14x14 = 196), ST 17 is roughly three times as strong (17x17 = 289), and ST 20 is four times as strong (20x20 = 400 = 4x100). Likewise, ST 7 is about half as strong (7x7 = 49), ST 6 is approximately 1/3 as strong (6x6 = 36), and ST 5 is only 1/4 as strong (5x5 = 25 = 100/4). Strength is more “open-ended” than other attributes; scores greater than 20 are common among beings such as large animals, fantasy monsters, and robots. Even a human could have a ST over 20 – record-setting weightlifters can be very strong! Those with nonhuman physiologies may, with the GM’s permission, purchase their ST with one or both of the limitations below. You may not reduce a point cost by more than 80% through limitations; treat any total over -80% as -80%. (For more on limitations, see p. 110.)",

		"name": "dexterity",
		"description": "Dexterity measures a combination of agility, coordination, and fine motor ability. It controls your basic ability at most athletic, fighting, and vehicle-operation skills, and at craft skills that call for a delicate touch. DX also helps determine Basic Speed (a measure of reaction time, p. 17) and Basic Move (how fast you run, p. 17). Those with nonhuman physiologies may, with the GM’s permission, purchase their DX with the following limitation. (TODO)",

		"name": "intelligence",
		"description": "Intelligence broadly measures brainpower, including creativity, intuition, memory, perception, reason, sanity, and willpower. It rules your basic ability with all “mental” skills – sciences, social interaction, magic, etc. Any wizard, scientist, or gadgeteer needs a high IQ first of all. The secondary characteristics of Will (p. 16) and Perception (p. 16) are based on IQ.",

		"name": "health",
		"description": "Health measures energy and vitality. It represents stamina, resistance (to poison, disease, radiation, etc.), and basic “grit.” A high HT is good for anyone – but it is vital for low-tech warriors. HT determines Fatigue Points (p. 16), and helps determine Basic Speed (p. 17) and Basic Move (p. 17).",
